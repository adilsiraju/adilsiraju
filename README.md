### üöÄ About Me

I'm a **B.E. graduate in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** (First Class with Distinction, CGPA: 7.33/10) from P A College of Engineering, Mangalore. I'm a skilled **Machine Learning & Deep Learning Engineer** with expertise in **PyTorch, FastAI, Hugging Face Transformers**, and building end-to-end ML pipelines, including data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and deployment. With hands-on experience in **computer vision, NLP, and MLOps**, I have a proven track record of delivering scalable, deployed ML applications with real-world impact. I'm passionate about leveraging AI to solve complex problems and am open to relocation (UAE/India tech hubs).
